# Falcon9_Simulation

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Click "Download Zip" on the GitHub page. Once downloaded click on the "Falcon9_Simulation-master" folder and then click on "RocketSimulation.xcodeproj" . Then click on the play button on the top left corner. Press 'i' to begin the simulation after reading the instructions. Enjoy! 

PURPOSE: 

This program represents an attempt to model a Falcon v1.1 launch, payload delivery, and landing. It includes air resistance, realistic estimates of the changing mass distribution and changing moment of inertia of the falcon, appropriate graviational force vectors (based on distance to Earth's center), accurate falcon dimensions/thrust, and more. It is not a perfect model however. The simulated rocket lacks grid fins and it has a simplified version of air resistance (unlike the different forces that act on the rocket at supersonic speeds). What affects the angle of the rocket in this simulation are the nitrogen thrusters, air resistance, and the gimbaled thrust system.
 
Naturally, the next step is to make an option to automate the launch, delivery, and landing, and see how well the computer can do. To avoid the exact same simulation every time, I would include random weather formations. I wonder if the computer would be able to land the falcon in a wind storm!
 
An even cooler version could include a launch and landing on Mars (you would be able to fast forward the months-long-journey!)
